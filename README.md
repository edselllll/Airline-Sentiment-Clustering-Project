# Airline-Sentiment-Clustering-Project

This was for a group project submitted for the module IT1244, which scored the highest marks for the cohort of AY24/25 Sem 1. This project was my first exposure to innovative and interesting clustering algorithms, and sparked my curiosity to learn more about Machine Learning. It was also this project that grew my interest in tackling Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

Using a dataset of over 50,000 tweets about US airlines, we experimented multiple models and visualisation techniques to cluster the tweets based on 'Positive', 'Neutral', 'Negative' sentiments. Models and techniques we used included: DBSCAN, Birch, Kmeans, t-SNE.

**Instructions**

1. Open Code Folder and download “IT1244_Team26_Project.ipynb", and everything in the Models and Dataset folder. 
2. Load the project notebook onto Google Colab. 
3. Upload “Tweets.csv” , and the saved models into the Google Colab ‘Files’ section. 
4. Begin the runtime from the first cell onwards, and the cleaned data, your models and respective metrics should start showing. 
5. There is a dropdown section at the bottom, this is the testing section for our saved models, where we hope to load our models successfully. 
6. To ensure there are not any errors, we go to “Runtime” -> “Restart session” and run the cells until the Parameter settings.
7. Go back to the dropdown section below and activate the saved models.
